0,"Climate-related displacement and migration is set to be the greatest challenge of our era. Communities in arid and semi-arid lands are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Exposure to extreme temperature irregularity and rapid rainfall fluctuations makes these communities more prone to recurring drought or flooding. Climate-induced displacement is on the rise.  This is not just an issue for fragile states, as the changing patterns of human migration mean that more people are forced to flee their communities in search of safe havens. It is the world’s most vulnerable people who are made to bear the brunt of climate change, though they are the least responsible for causing it, and are ill-equipped to deal with the consequences. With climate change intensifying humanitarian needs, international humanitarian agencies are overwhelmed, increasingly stretched, and lack the funding required to address these issues. We can see that the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals commitment to “leave no one behind” is failing. The time has come to prioritise climate-induced humanitarian problems and assemble a full range of resources to tackle it. The current humanitarian finance system is reactive and in desperate need of reform. As humanitarian crises become more complex, the demand for funding is struggling to keeping up with the supply available. The time has come to integrate a gender perspective into the climate change agenda The issue is that, as crises become more protracted, the coordinated response rate also rises. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the average UN coordinated humanitarian response rate is currently nine years — this is up from the average length of 5.2 years recorded in 2014. With the continuation of crises, multi-year funding is needed to help close the gap. The scope for non-traditional innovative sources of finance is enormous. Creating financial solutions to reach more of those at the bottom of the pyramid would be a major contribution to addressing this pressing issue and helping build local resilience. Climate change induced migration is adding a new layer of complexity to the area of gender, as women and girls are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change impacting education, maternal health and gender-based violence. With climate change disrupting their education, young girls are reportedly being taken out of school to marry early, creating a worryingly higher number of “child brides”. The repercussions have a profoundly negative impact on a young girl’s mental, physical and overall wellbeing. This article was originally published by WEF. To read the article, click here.

1,"Imagine being asked to identify and cut £140 million from your budget. Rather than shrink away, the former chief executive of the UK’s Wigan Council, Donna Hall, saw clearly that things were going to have to change. “We were faced with a burning platform,” she said. “And it gave us an opportunity to completely rethink our role as an institution and the relationship between the council and the community.” This rethink became “the Wigan Deal”, the Council’s strategy for change in the face of such deep cuts. The Deal, struck in 2012, was an informal agreement between Wigan Council and the residents of the town, designed to help them work together to create a better place to live. Wigan Council was unafraid to have one single strategy, with one name — giving clarity and purpose to its public servants. But kickstarting a change program at this scale requires a laser focus on your process and the people working alongside you. How did Wigan manage it? Wigan, a former mining town near Manchester in the North West of England with a population of 325,000, was identified as the UK’s third-most cut local government area in the early 2010s. But the town was no stranger to innovative thinking. Among other experimental work, in 2011-12 some of the council’s adult services team had been seconded to work with Dr Robin Pharoah, a consultant and expert in ethnographic methods, on a local currency project called the “Wigan Pound”. Pharoah trained the council staff to help out with his research, which included giving them a grounding in ethnographic techniques. This research approach looks at people in their cultural setting. It emphasises the importance of removing preconceptions — thinking with a ""blank mind"" — and taking the time to listen and see the world through the eyes of the person being studied. The research methods explore what is implicit as well as explicit, looking at what is not being said alongside what someone is telling you. Staff were given the freedom and permission to try different things, with the understanding that failure would be shared The results were a revelation. “I had the Director of Adult Social Care and Health come to me, asking ‘what have you done to my staff?’”, Pharoah remembered. His training reinvigorated the people involved: they returned to their day jobs with new insights into their interactions with citizens and each other. In particular, working with Pharoah taught staff to build relationships with service users, considering their needs with a blank mind and without judgement, before taking any action on their behalf. It played on the values involved with reciprocity — that both parties had to have a stake in the interaction. Following the team’s experiences on the Wigan Pound project, it was quickly decided that all staff were to be trained in ethnographic methods. This push was driven by the dynamism of the senior team, particularly Stuart Cowley, Director of Adult Social Care and Health, Pharoah said. “Stuart really understood that there was potential to turn some of my thinking into a wholescale programme for change,” Pharoah said. “Then he made it happen in a way that was relevant and exciting for his staff”. It didn’t stop there. The principle of understanding the perspective of the service user before building services was central to the Wigan Deal, and as such came to inform the council's entire corporate strategy from 2012 onwards. And so The Deal is based on the principle of reciprocity: both parties have a stake in the Deal and duties to fulfil as part of the partnership. As part of the Deal, local people were asked to recycle better, move more and look out for one another in exchange for the Council freezing local taxes and providing better public service delivery. Later, in 2014, came the Staff Deal, which promised council staff opportunities to learn and grow in exchange for being efficient, flexible and professional. The Deal became part of every interaction in every department. “We weren’t just going to do it in one pocket of one department,” said Hall. “It was about having the courage to roll it out at scale.” This gave the council a constancy and consistency of purpose, Hall argued. “It was really clear what our new role would be, and then we stuck to it,” she said. “There was no chopping and changing plans and strategies. There was one strategy, one theme through everything: the Deal.” Despite the shared vision, there was no ‘Eureka’ moment, said Hall, but instead a series of tweaks made, risks taken and assessments carried out. “It was much more: ‘let’s try this, see if it works,’” she said. “But there was a complete ban on pilots — when you pilot something, then often it’s so slow to be rolled out. So it ends up not happening at all.” Staff were given the freedom and permission to try different things, as part of this shared vision, with the understanding that failure would be shared. “Not everything worked,” said Hall. “But a lot did.” Three simple values were developed: be positive, be tangible to residents, and be courageous Pharoah was heavily involved as a consultant. “Wigan would squeeze me like a sponge for the day,” he said. “I would be up on the train from London, and pulled from one meeting to the next. No time would be wasted.” Change would happen quickly: it was instilled in staff that issues would be tackled head-on, rather than waiting for the next meeting. Pharoah’s favourite example of the Council’s reflexiveness was after a realisation that people were often using terms like job titles that meant different things to different people. “We were in a meeting, realised that this was a problem, and we stopped immediately, scrapping the agenda,” he said. “Instead, we made a glossary.” Pharoah was impressed by the agile approach. “Normally what would happen is that a glossary would be put on an action list, perhaps given as a task to someone who wasn’t in the room,” he said. “We solved the problem, there and then, and it enabled us to move on.” The ethnographic approach didn’t just give Wigan a frame with which to overhaul the services it provided. It also reinvigorated it as an organisation, leading to the development of new organisational values for the council and a fresh approach to the personal development of staff. This helped the council help its staff to survive and thrive amid the vast changes at play — both in terms of the innovative new projects being launched, and in terms of the large-scale cuts underway. Three simple values were developed: be positive, be tangible to residents, and be courageous. “These values drilled into every conversation that we had,” said Hall. Every appraisal and one-to-one meeting tapped becoming an opportunity to build a human connection. “The first question asked is always ‘how are you?’, rather than ‘where are you up to with the project?’” Hall also led regular cross-council sessions, named “Listening in to Action”, where staff could ask any question they wanted. She used the app, Slido, so that staff could pose their questions anonymously, and then vote on those they wanted answering. Projects run as part of the Deal have increased life expectancy in the town’s poorest areas by seven years She’d be asked questions like “why did you want to be the chief executive?”, or “are you going to just head off and get another job?”, and would give frank answers in return. Hall felt a responsibility to display physical leadership. “It’s important that staff get to know their leaders, knowing that they work for the leadership, rather than seeing themselves as a cog in the wheel,” she said. This culminated in the “BeWigan” experience, launched in 2016: an interactive half-day of training for every public servant who worked for the Council, from refuse collectors to the Chief Financial Officer. The idea came from two sparky graduate trainees, who pitched the idea to Hall. Frontline staff hosted the experience, taking their colleagues around a local government space which had been turned into a training centre. Attendees were taking to different physical zones exploring the Council’s past and future. The staff made pledges of commitment — 4000 in total — and were prompted to share their achievements on a graffiti wall. Carried out by in-house staff, the training saved £100,000 compared to a traditional training course. It’s a small but significant saving, speaking to The Deal’s wider cost-cutting approach: the Council is on course to save £160 million following the step change. And across the bigger picture, the Deal is changing lives: Hall is proudest that projects run as part of the Deal have increased life expectancy in the town’s poorest areas by seven years. For the Council’s employees, Pharoah’s training has been adapted, with a bricks and mortar bespoke training space built inside a local shopping centre. “When I saw it, it brought tears to my eyes,” he said. “It’s bureaucratised, but not in a bad way. They know it all now — they don’t need me anymore.” — Emma Sisk Discover inspiring tools, resources and policies curated for your needs.

2,"Refugees in Ghana have the same legal rights as ordinary citizens. They can live, work, and own businesses and properties, just as any other Ghanaian national. The refugee ‘problem’ in Ghana is small enough to manage and big enough to test economic and social integration solutions. In addition, policies that allow refugees to live and work in Ghana provide ample opportunities for governments and international organizations alike to prototype and create integration solutions without hindrance. These solutions could be replicated across different refugee and migrant communities. In many countries, there is a general fear of foreigners ‘stealing jobs’. Refugees or migrants who are not economically integrated will inadvertently depend on the state, as well as on certain other organizations. In effect, taxpayers’ money goes into refugee and migrant upkeep. Helping refugees become employable, active and independent is a smarter way to go. An EU report on migrant integration describes civic and political participation as two key areas considered to be positive indicators of migrant integration. The peaceful and accommodating Ghanaian cities that host refugees - Accra, Takoradi, Kumasi and Sunyani - would be ideal for testing integration and economic growth solutions. At the same time, they could set a good African example for other cities to follow. Discover inspiring tools, resources and policies curated for your needs.

3,"Luxembourg recently became the first country in the world to make all public transport free. As of March 1 2020, all buses, trains and trams throughout the country can be boarded without paying a fare – the largest area to institute free public transport for both residents and tourists so far. Free public transport, however, isn’t a new idea. Cities and towns have been experimenting with it since 1960 – Luxembourg merely clinches the title of the first country to roll it out nationwide. Today, at least 98 cities and towns around the world have some form of free public transport. In some areas, only residents can use it, or certain groups, such as senior citizens. It’s often introduced to encourage people to use their cars less – reducing congestion in cities and lowering air pollution and carbon emissions. But does it work? Economists tend to argue that free public transport is irrational and uneconomical because it generates “useless mobility”. This means that people will choose to move more simply because it’s free, increasing the costs of transport operators and subsidies for local authorities, while ultimately increasing emissions from public transport. Perhaps it’s no surprise that introducing free public transport increases the number of people using it. Strong passenger growth has been reported everywhere free public transport has been introduced, and the effects are more evident after several years. Research has also found that when fares are removed, only a small number of people who previously travelled by car make the switch. New passengers attracted by it tend to be pedestrians and cyclists rather than car drivers. The picture from most cities where free public transport has been introduced is that the increased passenger numbers overwhelmingly come from people who might have walked, cycled or not travelled otherwise. ""How successful fare abolition is at tempting people to use buses and trams depends on the quality of the service"" Three years after fares were abolished in Estonia’s capital, Tallinn, the number of bus passengers increased from 55% to 63%, while car journeys decreased only slightly (from 31% to 28%), together with walking (from 12% to 7%). Cycling (1%) and others (1%) remained the same. Experts from the Cosmopolis Centre in Brussels agree that the effects of free public transport on car traffic levels are marginal, arguing that by itself free public transport cannot significantly reduce car use and traffic, or improve air quality. So what can? Well, the researchers found that the behaviour of motorists and the transport mode they choose depends very little on public transport fares. Rather than relying on free public transport to engineer the shift, a more effective way to reduce the number of people choosing to drive could be regulating car use. Increasing the cost of parking, congestion charging, or increasing fuel taxes could all be combined with free fares to lower car demand. ""Fare abolition can help to make public transport visible as a valid alternative to the car in cities where many residents might have forgotten about it over time, due to chronic underinvestment"" How successful fare abolition is at tempting people to use buses and trams depends on the quality of the service. Cleaner and more reliable public transport must be a prerequisite for these schemes if buses and trams are to compete with the car, and making it part of a wider investment plan could have a big impact on the sustainability of transport. Fare abolition can help to make public transport visible as a valid alternative to the car in cities where many residents might have forgotten about it over time, due to chronic underinvestment.

4,"This article is written by Juan Vila, director of open government in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina Public infrastructure is a fundamental part of any city and its development: it impacts the quality of life of the residents by defining the type of public service they receive. Transportation, public spaces, parks, sidewalks and roads define the vital urban fabric in which we live, move, enjoy, work and much more. Currently, many governments are faced with the challenge of adapting their infrastructure to complex and multi-causal problems like environmental threats, inequality or population growth. This management by the states is crucial when we consider that the United Nations estimates 68% of the population will live in cities by 2050. In Latin America that figure grows significantly up to 81%. The OECD has identified governance as one of the primary challenges for successful infrastructure. When citizens aren’t heard in infrastructure plans, projects often face delays due to lawsuits or mistakes, which means they can’t meet the deadlines or go over budget. This is not a good way to provide public services. Fortunately, governments are increasingly aware that including citizens in urban development management is essential to achieve innovative and impactful solutions together. For this reason, open government might be a guide to develop the cities of the future. Open government can provide innovative ways of governing through the use of civic technology, better standards, open data and spaces for dialogue and collaboration. Adding the voice of citizens provides a framework to locate where the most urgent problems are, while opening information so that citizens can monitor what the government is doing and base their demands on evidence. Moreover, generating, analysing and disseminating relevant data allows us to address this infrastructure challenge within a comprehensive governance improvement plan. And at the same time, open government increases transparency and opens information related to contracting and execution processes in infrastructure works, which is important because it helps to understand how the government spends the public money and keeps public works accountable. Creating an urban planning platform that can translate large amounts of infrastructure data into a simple visualisation is essential to deliver data to the public Creating an urban planning platform that can translate large amounts of infrastructure data into a simple visualisation is essential to deliver this type of data to the public. These platforms deliver on a fundamental goal of being able to offer clear, quality information that enables informed and evidence-based participation. Seeing data on public works or urban planning standards allows involved actors to obtain the necessary information to participate, monitor, propose analysis or foster new developments. BA Obras is a platform that was created to communicate public works to citizens in a new and innovative way. It displays more than a thousand individual projects where you can obtain information about the work, start and end dates, bidding amounts, the contractor in charge, the contract that awards the work, description, and details of it, among other data. There are now eight cities in Latin America that have utilised the Open Source software of BA Obras, housed in the repository of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). In Buenos Aires, there are already many successful examples of citizens being brought together to co-create public spaces. For example, in 2019 participatory conferences were conducted with the local community to decide how to transform an old trainway shed. Through the initiative of more than 200 neighbours, a once abandoned area was remodelled to include a park, a public library, and workshop spaces. Buenos Aires has also created Open Map BA. This tool opens and unifies urban data previously spread out among diverse areas of government. It is now gathered on one website so that it can be directly accessed. In the process, it manages to translate thousands of pages of regulations and sources of information in an interactive site that citizens can use to explore each lot of the city in detail. The life of a city is not only in government hands. It is also shaped by private activity and economic initiatives that influence the urban fabric But the life of a city is not only in government hands. It is also shaped by private activity and economic initiatives that influence the urban fabric. For example, the construction of buildings, houses, offices, shops, among others. There is a demand for strategic information — such as business inspections, land use permits or construction rules — that feed into urban planning data in general. And that is why some governments have decided to move forward with the opening of urban data and the creation of platforms that visualise it to make it accessible to all. For example, Barcelona developed Geoportal BCN with all the urban data from the city, or ZoLa from New York, which displays the zoning data through layers of maps. Both of these platforms were an inspiration for the creation of Open Map BA. The initiatives taken in Buenos Aires and elsewhere gives us the opportunity to find co-created solutions to the challenges big cities face. In this sense, we believe the answers have to be developed collaboratively. This can only be done by listening to citizens, strengthening the spaces for dialogue and citizen participation, as the spirit of open government mandates. That is why, ultimately, we democratise information about urban planning. — Juan Vila (Picture Credit: Unsplash) Discover inspiring tools, resources and policies curated for your needs.

5,"With the coronavirus crisis sweeping the globe, health data has never been more important. Almost every news story now features mathematical models and statistics designed to enable health care professionals and government planners to make the right decisions on how and when to make interventions. But long before the current crisis emerged, the City Health Dashboard was helping to harvest huge amounts of information all pertaining to urban health in specific American cities, the end goal being to deliver the information to health professionals and city leaders at a level of granularity that had never been done before. “Prior to the Dashboard’s debut, there was not a publicly-available source for city health data; most health data were available at the county or state level,” said Ben Spoer, director of metrics and analytics at City Health Dashboard. With 80% of Americans living in urban areas, Spoer added that relying on data from non-urban populations did not give an accurate reading of what particular health challenges city-dwellers face. City Health Dashboard on the other hand, harvests 35 different types of health information from a multitude of sources including life expectancy, obesity, number of children in poverty, clinical care and insurance metrics, education, racial bias, and income — all specific to a particular neighbourhood or city boundary which is updated regularly. The dashboard empowers cities to identify and intervene upon health challenges by providing the city-specific data required to identify and address these challenges The City Health Dashboard project started in 2017. A pilot version was developed in close collaboration with four cities, Providence, Rhode Island, Flint, Michigan, Waco, Texas, and Kansas City, Kansas. Officially launched in May 2018 with 500 large US cities — those with populations greater than 66,000 people — it has recently added 10 small New Jersey cities and this April will add 260 more large cities across the US. Spoer added that the data itself is culled from a number of large, nationally available datasets. Some of them, like the US Census, which provides data for many of the site’s social and economic factors metrics, or the 500 Cities project data, which provides data for many of its health behaviours metrics, are freely available. But others, like the National Vital Statistics Systems data, which provides much of the system’s health outcome data, requires a data use agreement with the US government.
They also buy select datasets, for example Parkserve (providing Park Access) and Walkscore. As well as gathering a wide range of accurate information, simplicity of use was one of the biggest concerns to designers said Spoer. “The Dashboard data empowers cities to take action on health issues.
“While city leaders possess deep knowledge and expertise about their cities, funders and policymakers often require hard data to justify funding proposals or making policy changes. “With this in mind, the Dashboard empowers cities to identify and intervene upon health challenges by providing the city-specific data required to identify and address these challenges.” He cites a number of examples of how the Dashboard has helped inform city leaders to make interventions. The dashboard drills down into the city’s neighbourhood data to provide a level of clarity and granularity they previously lacked In their Access to Care working group, community health workers at Prosper Waco, a collective impact initiative in Waco, Texas, have used the Dashboard’s data to design evidence-based preventative health community events in their neighbourhoods, tailored to the population health and social needs of their individual catchment areas. Using the Dashboard to address low rates of physical activity in underserved areas, the Healthy Communities Office in Providence, Rhode Island discovered that walkability and safety concerns had a greater influence on low activity than obesity itself, which had previously been thought to be its major driver. The Dashboard measures on walkability were then combined with state data on bikeability to identify barriers and opportunities for increased physical activity in specific neighbourhoods and spur the design of more safe and walkable streets. And until recently, the Clifton Health Department in New Jersey had had to rely on county-level data from Passaic County to meet its data needs. Spoer said: “For a city as racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse as Clifton, this information was too broad to truly reflect residents’ health, and thus not local enough to drive change.” He added the health department now uses the Dashboard to drill down into the city’s neighbourhood data to provide a level of clarity and granularity they previously lacked. He said: “They’ve been able to use the Dashboard’s quantitative data alongside qualitative surveys from local community health organizations, to highlight equity issues across the city for their Community Health Assessment, part of the process to help them become a nationally accredited local public health department.” The website has had 88,885 unique users across 132,905 sessions since its launch with plans to expand to additional new cities and add new metrics as public health service priorities shift. The team are also currently working with colleges and universities to explore how the Dashboard can be used as an educational tool. He says the team are interested in bringing the Dashboard to other countries, but due to its reliance on secondary data to populate its metrics, it would require countries with robust demographic and health data systems that capture uniform data across multiple cities. “Many middle-and-low income countries, which could benefit from such a Dashboard, do not yet have these data systems and a funding partner would be needed as well,” he adds. — Mark Smith (Picture credit: Death to Stock) Discover inspiring tools, resources and policies curated for your needs.

6,"Meanwhile, as refugees became more settled, Turkey needed to think about how refugees can integrate into society through work. But Turkey's government found a way to both strengthen its healthcare services for refugees and help shape the future of its workforce — retrain Syrian doctors to work in the Turkish healthcare system. Not only do more refugees have care that meets their needs as a result, but some of them have a brand new route to work in their host country. In 2011, refugees began migrating to Turkey from Syria. By 2013, they were in the hundreds of thousands. By 2015, there were more than a million refugees. By 2016, this had tripled. In cities in Southern Turkey, the number of Syrian patients was matching the number of Turkish patients in its health centres. “Syrian patients soon overstretched national health services,” said Dr Santino Severoni, Coordinator of Public Health and Migration for the World Health Organisation (WHO). On top of treating the influx of new patients’ health problems, which may have been worsened by long stints in insecure accommodation, cultural and language barriers can also play a huge part of eating into doctors’ capacity. Reports were coming back from the field that longer-term integration was required. In Turkey, each person is given a family physician. Patient empowerment is central to the Turkish medical system, with a big focus on primary care. So when the Turkish Ministry of Health established migrant health centres to strengthen the health infrastructure for refugees, they were established with this in mind. ""To transfer qualifications, Turkey created its own accreditation mechanism to be used in humanitarian disasters."" The WHO has provided support to seven of its Refugee Health Training Centres in seven Turkish provinces since mid-2016. In 2017, the WHO’s initiative helped establish a network of 178 Migrant and Refugee Health Centers across the country where linguistic and culturally-sensitive services for the Syrian population are offered free of charge. By September 2019, the network was completed and it now covers over 30 Turkish provinces. Some 600,000 consultations have taken place and the program has led to increased access to health services for almost 20,000 refugees and migrants. But the centres don’t just offer health services to refugees — they also train Syrian health professionals to become doctors in Turkey. Over 2,200 Syrian doctors and nurses have now completed their training. Beyond its impact on the immediate welfare of sick refugees, the scheme is creating job opportunities for migrants. Some 1,300 Syrians have been hired by Turkey’s Ministry of Health. ""The training aims to adapt the Syrian health professionals into the new setting in Turkey"" To transfer qualifications, Turkey created its own accreditation mechanism to be used in humanitarian disasters. The Turkish Higher Education Council worked alongside the Ministry of Health to delegate authority to the Ministry so that it could approve Syrians’ medical qualifications. The Ministry established its own committee to interview health workers for positions. In replicating the program, Severoni suggested policymakers should figure out what makes doctors and nurses tick — “address the language, cultural, financial, burn-out [factors] and motivation of health professionals”. There’s an effort to help the Syrian medics settle in Turkey, but not change their entire approach to care. “The training aims to adapt the Syrian health professionals into the new setting in Turkey,” said Severoni. The training includes a one-week theoretical course and six weeks of on-the-job experience, where Syrian doctors and nurses are posted in WHO-supported healthcare centres across Turkey. In 2018, the training was expanded to include training in basic computer skills, health information systems, language and community health. Without basic knowledge of the national health data systems, confidential information risked being left insecure. Participants can then work in the Ministry’s national health centres, caring for Turkish and Syrian patients alike. These new healthcare workers can deliver culturally sensitive health consultations and strengthen refugee access to quality health services.

8,"This piece was written by Nick Kimber, a public policy professional working in London. For more like this, see our government innovation newsfeed. The funding crisis engulfing UK local government is now headline news. While those working in public policy and delivering services have for years understood and wrestled with the seemingly irreconcilable challenge of a rise in demand coupled with a huge reduction in resources, it is now talked about at the school gate (where the crisis is keenly felt). One county council, Northamptonshire, is effectively bankrupt, with experts warning that others will surely follow. In anticipation of the worst, some councils are even starting to have honest conversations with communities about providing only the most basic services under some funding scenarios. The demographic and funding crisis which results from a rapidly ageing population and a fractured health and social care system is broadly understood; less so the huge pressure facing children’s social services, where the number of referrals has increased by 100,000 in a decade. Nationally, councils have spent almost a billion pounds more than they budgeted for to keep children safe. The risk of another case like that of Baby P, despite the reform that tragedy brought about, is now high, the result this time not of bureaucratic negligence and fractures between agencies but of chronic mismatch between what has to be done and what is available to pay for it. Since 2010, successive governments have had no effective strategy to deal with this fiscal reality. The most promising, devolution and the establishment of city mayors, is significant and worth building on. But it is partial, and to date insufficient in its ambition. In fact, the sharp reduction in resources since 2010 and the current unfolding crisis arguably mask a deeper malaise affecting UK public services. Prior to the economic downturn, increased investment in public services was not shifting outcomes in line with aspirations. New Labour governments made significant investments, but these were predicated on addressing social and economic problems that, by and large, we know how to solve, and doing so through a mixture of bureaucratic centralism and market mechanisms. Improving educational standards through the literacy and numeracy hour, or reducing waiting lists for hip replacements, for example. Growing complexity has proved resistant to linear solutions informed by the traditional tools of policy analysis Growing complexity due to broader societal shifts — from long-term, structural unemployment to growing numbers of people with multiple, long-term chronic health conditions — has proved resistant to linear solutions designed primarily by Whitehall and informed by the traditional tools of policy analysis. Capacity and appetite to concentrate on these issues, let alone attention to dedicate to an overhaul of the entire approach, looks likely to be sapped by Brexit and its aftermath for years to come. But, as ever, there are reasons to be cheerful. In towns and neighbourhoods across the country, there is work going on which provides some clues as to how places can get a grip, face the challenges and develop a different mindset. Broadly, I think these coalesce around three key questions: The very best councils and their partners are feeling their way… Deciding — Councils like Camden in London, building on international examples, have set long-term visions based on deep deliberation with local communities. Citizen juries and assemblies represent genuine innovation in our democratic and civic life, helping forge consensus and deal with divergence at a time where trust in public institutions is low. There is an opportunity to use these approaches to deal with the hard choices which are often local governments’ to make, legitimising difficult decisions and unleashing creative responses from the community. Designing — Councils like Hackney are leading the charge for citizen-centred design approaches, which demand that we put citizens at the centre of how we build and change public services. These are gaining a critical mass in local governments, which intuitively understand the public value that can be unleashed by genuine co-design, working openly with citizens “in the room” from the beginning. The promise of this type of approach is that it addresses complexity, designing services around the patterns of individuals lives. It also represents a far more evidence-based approach, emphasising an understanding of the user experience and iteration and prototyping before spending public money. There is no getting away from the fact that the cash crisis is real, nor that Whitehall’s willingness and capacity to tackle it is limited. There are lessons to be learned from this generational fight for a new type of local public service But there are many lessons to be learned from this generational fight for a new type of local public service, and there is real hope in amongst the gloom. There is a developing eco-system of progressive local authorities committed to these types of approaches. They are working with partners in higher education and the voluntary sector amongst others, and with a new generation of value-based consultancies who are passionate about place-based services.

9,"This piece was written by Audrey Macklin, Professor and Chair in Human Rights Law, Director of the Centre for Criminology and Sociolegal Studies at the University of Toronto. It was originally published on The Conversation. The global north tends to view the global south as a source of refugees, and it often implements policies aimed at preventing those refugees from reaching the global north. Brazil recently set a bold precedent that should make those northern states adjust the lens. Its policy toward Venezuelan refugees, in contrast to its wealthier peers, is pragmatic, humane and sensible. Venezuela’s political, economic and social collapse has generated a population haemorrhage: More than 4.5 million, or one in seven Venezuelans, have left, and most remain in the region. Colombia hosts around 1.5 million. About 260,000 have entered Brazil through its northern border with Venezuela, at a rate of about 500 per day. Three elements of the Brazilian response stand out. First, Brazil has provided basic shelters and services — not detention — to meet the urgent and immediate needs of people streaming across the Venezuelan border into Roraima province. Brazil partners with United Nations agencies, as well as international, regional and domestic aid agencies that contribute financial and logistical assistance. The Brazilian government has also initiated a policy to redistribute arrivals to the interior of Brazil to reduce the burden on Roraima. Next, Brazil has expanded the scope of entitlement to refugee status. The 1984 Cartagena Declaration adopted a regional approach to refugee protection, mindful of the history of Latin American states as both producers and recipients of refugee flows. ""First, Brazil has provided basic shelters and services — not detention — to meet the urgent and immediate needs of people streaming across the Venezuelan border into Roraima province."" The international refugee definition contained in the UN 1951 Refugee Convention is individualistic and requires proof that applicants fear personal persecution. But the Cartagena definition supplements that narrow approach by including people who have fled their countries because their lives, safety or freedom have been threatened by generalized violence, foreign aggression, internal conflicts, massive violation of human rights or other circumstances that have seriously disturbed public order. In June 2019, Brazil’s National Committee for Refugees issued a detailed report concluding that the crisis in Venezuela falls under the purview of the Cartagena Declaration. People labelled as migrants elsewhere because they fall outside the narrow terms of the UN Refugee Convention definition are included as refugees under Cartagena. In December 2019, Brazil took an even bolder step: It dispensed with the requirement of individualized refugee status determination for each Venezuelan asylum applicant. Applicants in Brazil, with documentary proof of identity and without a criminal record, will receive refugee status without an interview. Refugee status, in turn, entitles them to permanent resident status, access employment, public health care, education and other social services available to Brazilians. After four years, they may apply for naturalization. Within the first month of the policy, about 21,000 Venezuelans were processed under this new system. ""In December 2019, Brazil took an even bolder step: It dispensed with the requirement of individualized refugee status determination for each Venezuelan asylum applicant."" Put this in comparative perspective: Unlike the United States and Australia, Brazil has not set up detention centres, separated families and caged children in order to punish Venezuelans for fleeing intolerable circumstances. That means that Brazil has not wasted scarce resources on vicious and futile deterrence strategies. Brazil also applies a refugee definition that responds to contemporary patterns of forced migration. And unlike other states with sophisticated refugee status determination regimes, Brazil’s group-based recognition of Venezuelans avoids the creation of a mammoth backlog of Venezuelan asylum applications. Resources that would have been wasted processing individual Venezuelan asylum claims will be directed at managing settlement and integration, and on determining asylum claims from other places. Not all Venezuelans who arrive in Brazil seek asylum. Many transit through Brazil in order to rejoin family or friends in nearby states, such as Argentina or Chile. Others go back and forth between Brazil and Venezuela to deliver food, medicine and other necessities to family and communities who remain there. And some do not wish to see themselves as refugees and so do not claim that legal status. Brazil also allows Venezuelans to obtain two-year renewable temporary resident permits that also give them access to employment and to public services like health care and education. There is good reason to believe that whether they are admitted on temporary permits, or permanently as refugees, most Venezuelans will go home voluntarily if and when the circumstances that caused them to flee have improved. That’s another advantage of regional integration programs that enable people to live, work and continue their lives in proximity to their country of origin. Regional solidarity plays a paradoxical role in Brazil’s initiative. The Cartagena Declaration, as well as a regional free movement initiative under the Mercosur trade bloc, show the emergence of South American co-operation in migration. On the other hand, President Jair Bolsonaro has not distinguished himself in the past as a champion of refugees and displaced people. One wonders whether his antipathy toward Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro might have more to do with the Brazilian hospitality shown to Venezuelans fleeing Maduro’s regime than solidarity. One is reminded here of refugee politics during the Cold War. But whatever the motive, the current policy has much to commend it. The system is certainly imperfect. Brazil is a middle-income country, and so the quality and availability of public services is uneven. Bureaucratic inefficiency and lack of co-ordination among different branches of the state cause delay and confusion. Venezuela is not the only source of asylum-seekers; Brazil also receives asylum seekers from Haiti, Africa and the Middle East. Local aid organizations struggle to fill service gaps, but their resources are also strained by the surge in Venezuelan arrivals. The absence of habitable and affordable accommodation is also a massive and critical problem in Brazil. Refugees may have no alternative but to live in extremely dangerous and violent places. Language training is weak, though Portuguese is relatively easy for Spanish speakers to learn. Even though refugees can lawfully seek employment, some employers still take advantage of newcomers by overworking and underpaying them.

10,"This article was written by Madhu Raghunath, Sector Leader in Sustainable Development at the World Bank. It was originally published on World Bank Blogs. What struck me immediately upon moving to Manila eight months ago was the cultural diversity and the warmth of its citizens. As an urban planner, I could not help but think of the large opportunities but also unused potential the city offers in terms of jobs, education, access to welfare services, among others. Manila is a gateway for many people to improve their family’s quality of life. As vibrant and dynamic as it is, there is much the city could improve through better urban planning to address visible issues of congestion, lack of affordable housing, and more broadly, providing a livable and healthy urban environment so that citizens can thrive. Now more than ever, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgency of integrating various considerations in urban planning, including infrastructure, environment, economic activities, and spaces to bring communities together in our cities. COVID-19 is a pandemic and threatens all of us. Hotspots in one barangay increase the threat to the whole metropolitan area. This pandemic has highlighted the need for more equitable management of our cities. Urban management is fundamental for efficient and effective service delivery, especially for ensuring that all citizens have equal access to quick and coordinated response efforts in times of crises and disasters. This pandemic and our experiences with the shutdown of megacities all over the globe compels us to revisit the basic tenets of urban planning and urban management. We must work collectively to make our cities more livable and designed around the health, safety, and well-being of all residents. What does this mean in practice? There is a glaring disparity in level and quality of service delivery between informal mostly poor neighbourhoods and wealthier areas. According to the 2017 World Bank report on Urbanization in the Philippines, close to 11% of Metro Manila’s population live in informal settlements. Not all informal settlers are income poor, but many are vulnerable to external shocks that can easily push them below the poverty line. ""The lack of mobility options impacts vulnerable sections of society like the poor, elderly and disabled"" Many families that live in informal settlements rely on minimum wage earnings and contractual work. These incomes are seasonal with no job security, no social protection measures such as paid sick leave or family leave benefits. Those engaged in small businesses suffer from unsteady levels of income. Many of them have limited savings that are exhausted in the event of any external shocks. Their situation is exacerbated by poor living conditions including a lack of reliable water supply and sanitation, overcrowding in living tenements, and weak healthcare systems. Under these circumstances, how can social distancing be practiced? How can households afford basic services like water supply and sanitation to follow protective hygiene practices like handwashing? Or even afford a doctor visit? Local governments are best placed to step-up through increased coordination across jurisdictions and meet the promise of inclusive high-quality services for all but this requires a proactive approach to urban management that spans beyond election cycles. When Metro Manila was placed under Enhanced Community Quarantine, public transportation grounded to a halt. Jeepneys, tricycles, buses and trains were prohibited from operating. Commuters and even essential medical personnel walked long distances or borrowed bikes to get to the hospital. Public transport could not restart because social distancing measures present a serious challenge, especially for small public operators like jeepneys. The lack of mobility options impacts vulnerable sections of society like the poor, elderly and disabled. Weak urban transport is hampering the economic productivity of the cities as people’s choice of mobility is very limited in the Philippines. For example, the development of urban transport directly competes with the increase of private cars in Manila’s congested road network. ""In Medellin, Colombia, libraries are being designed as safe spaces for people without the fear of drugs or crime"" With COVID-19, it is time to rethink urban mobility solutions. In the short-term, the focus would be on demand management including social distancing measures, fleet sanitation, enforcement of safety protocols in informal modes of transport and management of public’s travel expectations. In the medium-term, there needs to be a focus on public transport reform including inter-jurisdictional coordination of public transit and better management of informal transport providers. This can be achieved by bringing in multi-modal solutions such as mass transit systems like Metro and, Bus Rapid Transit and start thinking of non-motorized solutions like bicycles, e-vehicles alongside main corridors to offer diverse mobility solutions for people. Cities across the world are rethinking urban design, from hardscapes of concrete and glass to more green solutions such as vertical gardens. Public parks are being designed to serve as multipurpose infrastructure, for example using a watershed approach to capture stormwater during the rainy season and simultaneously use if for recreational purpose. Similarly, iconic design in open spaces allows for people of all ages to enjoy amenities as we see in Medellin, Colombia, where libraries are being designed as safe spaces for people without the fear of drugs or crime. Future planning will also need to take into account access to health services during epidemics and integrate it with mobility solutions. We are advancing rapidly with digital solutions like the internet of things or artificial intelligence for evidence-based planning. As part of its COVID economic recovery efforts, greater emphasis could be given to use of geospatial tools for planning and implementation of infrastructure. This a fantastic opportunity for cities in the Philippines to interconnect with the rest of its peers and also use these solutions in proactive urban planning. Cities attract talent, innovation and creativity. As people are pulled into increasingly dense and dynamic urban centres around the world, a secure, high-quality, life and sustainable environment are becoming imperative in the planning discourse.

11,"This opinion piece was written by Jack Archer, CEO of the Regional Australia Institute. It appears in our refugees and migration and resilient rural communities newsfeeds. At the Regional Australia Institute (RAI) this is an issue we are closely monitoring — as are many regional communities across the country. While immigration numbers remain a hot topic, the reason we need to rethink our migration system in Australia is not only to alleviate congestion levels in our big cities, but also to address the workforce needs in many of our regional cities and towns. Currently, the migration system in Australia can’t respond to that workforce demand outside Melbourne, Sydney, and south-east Queensland. However, by force of habit, most Australians will assert if asked that there are no jobs in regional Australia. This damaging and pernicious generalisation doesn’t stand up to simple scrutiny. This view is often pushed by those who should be better informed. I would encourage them to consult the latest statistics and to take the time to talk to businesses and local leaders in places like Kalgoorlie, Warrnambool, the South Coast of Victoria, Orana region, and the Riverina in NSW. This effort will confirm that getting permanent workers to take up existing opportunities in local industries and services is a major constraint. In the last two years, the figures that we have been monitoring show that job vacancies in regions around Australia have gone up by 20 percent. This is in stark contrast to our major capital cities where the figures have only risen by 10 percent Of course, there will always be some regions at the wrong end of a business cycle, and there are certainly areas with entrenched unemployment challenges. But this is also true of the major cities which are generally assumed to be fountains of opportunity for all. Many other regions are chronically short of additional workers, have been so for many years and will become more so as the local population ages. I completely agree with those who’ve argued recently that forcing migrants to go to regions won’t work. It is also not necessary. We should not try to use visa conditions to force or convince the thousands of urban international students seeking a pathway to permanent residency into regional areas. These potential migrants, in the majority of cases, are not the right fit for regions. Instead, we need a migration system that facilitates people with the right skills for regional work and who hail from regional and rural areas overseas. We know there are many migrants who aspire to be part of our regional communities. We also know there are many regional communities who are ready to welcome them. The additional good news is that reform can be done simply and quickly. Designated Area Migration Agreements (DAMA) are an existing policy that can be adapted to prioritise regions with specific job shortages that can’t be filled by local workers. Future agreements need to be simpler and less onerous to implement, as well as being better aligned to the diversity of regional job shortages. Agreements should also be reached with regions within a three month period, rather than two years. All of this is readily achievable if the government is willing to reform and proactively implement this existing policy. At the RAI, we have documented some incredible examples of places around the country where communities have embraced migration. This week in Bendigo, a new research report has found that in net present value terms, the total economic impact from the regional resettlement of the Karen population on the Bendigo economy is estimated to have been $67.1 million over a ten year period. Furthermore, an extra 177 full-time-equivalent jobs were created in the local economy, as a direct result of the Karen resettlement. Australia needs to prioritise regional workforce needs. A five-year visa could help, but to be honest, we don’t think it is necessary. A few changes to the existing DAMA policy, and some resources for local communities to help welcome migrants, would go a long towards addressing the workforce shortage experienced in so many areas across regional Australia. — Jack Archer (Picture credit: Pexels) Discover inspiring tools, resources and policies curated for your needs.

12,"This article is written by Zachary Spicer, the Director of Research and Outreach at the Institute of Public Administration of Canada and Joseph Lyons, Assistant Professor and Director of the Local Government Program at Western University in London, Ontario, Canada. Being a small town public servant can be tough. Municipalities are the most constrained levels of government in Canada. They have limited legal and fiscal autonomy, which creates capacity, resource, and service delivery challenges. These challenges are often amplified in small municipalities. Unlike their larger urban counterparts, small municipalities have small budgets and small staff contingents responsible for providing critical functions. Staff time is limited and the opportunities to step back and examine the state of the organisation or review existing services or processes are rare. Even though the capacity and resources of small municipal governments differs greatly from their larger peers, the expectations from residents are often not that different when it comes to digital offerings. We are all leading increasingly digital lives in both urban and rural areas, and we have the same expectations that our needs from local government can be met online. Digital services are perhaps even more in demand in sparsely populated rural areas where a car trip to the municipal office may take upwards of an hour. Putting services online is, therefore, a priority for many rural residents, politicians, and administrators. Lack of capacity – technologically and otherwise – is often the biggest barrier. In January, Policy Ready and the Institute of Public Administration of Canada launched a new Digital Government Case Study Series. Since then we have detailed the digital transformation of the Ontario Student Assistance Program and the Ontario Environmental Registry. Both cases involved large digital shifts. The next case in the Digital Government Case Study Series examines digital transformation on a smaller scale: the creation of a municipal app in the small town of Grey Highlands, Ontario. An app isn’t groundbreaking digital innovation, but in a small, rural community it can be a lifeline to essential government services. For governments with limited capacity, even creating a basic digital service like an app can be a huge challenge. So, when it’s done well, others should take notice. The case of Grey Highlands provides an example of how a municipality can embrace innovative digital change with limited resources. Like many rural municipalities, Grey Highlands had long been searching for a way to optimise its customer service operations. The municipality is geographically large, meaning that getting services at the municipal office may require a drive of up to an hour. Grey Highlands also has a significant seasonal population, which means many residents are physically located outside of the community for long periods of the year. There was a long-standing desire to better engage with both groups. The solution, however, had proven elusive for sometime. The inspiration for an app in Grey Highlands was sparked during a municipal innovation conference. The then Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), Rob Adams, was impressed by the ways larger municipalities were moving forward on digital transformation and wanted his municipality to pursue similar initiatives. Adams empowered his team to begin looking at alternatives to the municipality’s existing customer service processes. A small group of staff began examining the feasibility of various technologies. Ideas eventually coalesced around a mobile solution that would take the burden away from customer service staff at the municipal office and engage community members virtually. After abandoning several early attempts at using different web-based client servicing tools and unsuccessfully searching for a firm that could make an app that was affordable for the community, the development team in Grey Highlands embarked on the task of creating a municipal app themselves. Failure, Adams preached, was permissible in Grey Highlands, as long as the intent was in the spirit of the public good Capacity and resources challenges loomed large over the process — the municipality had no developers or programmers on staff and funds were limited. After examining several platforms, the team settled on AppyPie, which provides a subscription service for app design, similar to website design services like SquareSpace. AppyPie is a digital platform for creating apps and websites which does not require users to learn code, thereby opening up the process of app creation to those without a tech background. Not only was the functionality the right fit for the community, at $300 a year, the price was right, too. By analysing traffic patterns on the municipality’s website, the design team was able to determine which functions, services, and information areas were most frequently visited. This information was used to establish the base functionality of the app. In total, the app took about one week to create and officially launched in February 2019. Residents of Grey Highlands can now get information about important services and interact with the municipality through their mobile devices no matter where they happen to be. The app would not have been created without a significant change in Grey Highlands’ organisational culture under the leadership of CAO Rob Adams. Through primary interviews, we were able to determine that when Adams arrived in Grey Highlands in January 2017 he found a detectable amount of conflict within the administrative ranks of the municipality, as well as on council. Long-standing political battles were affecting staff morale and motivation, as directions from council were often unclear and politically charged. Staff regularly field calls from other municipalities about how to create their own app. Their advice? Don’t delay, just get started Soon after Adams was hired, several senior staff members quit. While large-scale staff turnover can be frustrating and organisationally disruptive, Adams saw it as an opportunity. He actively recruited several people from other municipalities and the private sector, trying to find the right personalities to fit the organisation. At the same time, he set out to improve relationships, build trust among employees, and convince them that he was committed to meaningful organisational change. Adams also earned goodwill from the council by successfully managing several long-standing and controversial development projects. These early wins gave him cover to experiment with new and innovative projects. As these improvements materialised, Adams began to promote the idea of measured risk-taking in support of innovation. Adams had spent much of his career as an entrepreneur and recognised the value of failure and how being given license to fail allowed for new ideas to be tested and eventually implemented. The lessons learned from failure are not valued as highly in the public sector as they are elsewhere, largely because public sector officials have a stewardship role over community wellbeing and tax dollars. Failure, Adams preached, was permissible in Grey Highlands, as long as the intent was in the spirit of the public good. With supportive leadership, an improved organisational culture, buy-in from council, and a new perspective on failure and innovation, staff had the encouragement and confidence they needed to go about developing and testing the app on their own, without explicit direction from senior management. Had the various organisational elements described above been absent or working at cross-purposes, this simply would not have happened. As such, it is possible to point to the following lessons for other governments to create a similar culture: The Grey Highlands app has found a receptive audience — close to 10% of the population in the community has downloaded and used the app. The municipality has also won two innovation awards because of the app from the Association of Municipalities of Ontario (P.J. Marshall Award) and the Association of Municipal Managers, Clerks and Treasurers of Ontario (E.A. Danby Award). Staff regularly field calls from other municipalities about how to create their own app. Their advice? Don’t delay, just get started. — Zachary Spicer and Joseph Lyons (Picture credit: Unsplash) Discover inspiring tools, resources and policies curated for your needs.

13,"This article is written by Mathew Yarger, head of smart cities, social impact & regulatory affairs department at the IOTA Foundation The city of tomorrow! Smart cities are the future! Technology can make everything better! Data is the new gold! There’s little doubt that headlines like these have graced the front page of your local media. It has become common for many industries to focus on enabling the “smart city of tomorrow”, motivated by the prospects of large-scale investment and economic growth. They got this way through their shift from technology providers to data aggregators. In her book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power, Shoshana Zuboff points out a harsh yet revealing perspective when she speaks of the consumers saying: “You are not the product … You are the abandoned carcass” Enlightening readers to the scale of data consumption that happens via their devices and how the access is being abused. This doesn’t have to be the case though. Data can be used for good, and should be. The same level of growth can occur in our cities, if we can bring the companies together with the cities they work in, and with the views of the residents they employ. Enabling cascading growth for the benefit of all stakeholders. There’s a good explanation for this. Jim Collins, an author who carries out in-depth research on business management and company sustainability, has written many insightful books, and they all outline an underlying theme that typically leads to exponential growth and transformation: the power of using empirical evidence to enable informed decision-making. Making smart use of evidence is one of the key characteristics of effective leaders Making smart use of evidence is one of the key characteristics of effective leaders. It enables them to make informed decisions quickly — but not carelessly — and to guide innovation based on the evidence that one can gather in order to better inform the developments of said innovation. It’s also a key characteristic of companies that eventually outpace their competitors. They make important decisions based on empirical evidence, not their gut feelings and short-term gain. This is something the technological giants of today are now intimately familiar with and it sets the leaders in the industry apart from those trying to catch up. This is what is enabling companies to reach trillion-dollar market caps. Shouldn’t our cities be integrating the same practices to evolve as dynamically and efficiently as those leading companies do? When we talk about evidence, the focus of the conversation always falls back on one thing: data. Where should it be stored? How can it be secured? Who owns it and who are the stakeholders? Data can change everything, for better or for worse. This is especially true in the context of Smart Cities, where data is everything. However, there is a common stakeholder that is often left out of the conversation — the citizen. While public servants often hope to enable solutions that serve citizens interest, solutions providers often build things focused on the technical requirements as they understand them. We can look at the transition to Gov.uk, where they transitioned more than 300 different UK government websites to the central Gov.uk site. Kathy Settle, director for local resilience capability and stakeholder engagement in the UK government, recalls that during the digital transition, “things were built on the basis of what people thought the user needs were. Some of it turned out to be wrong.” Or as Edouard Geffray, director general of education in France, explained in his 2017 interview with David Ménascé for Field Actions Science Reports: “Data can indeed objectify the urban system, but only political will can point it in the direction of the general interest … The operator has the economic and technical intelligence of the data, but the community also has its social intelligence. That’s where there is something to be invented. It will be by bringing together all the city’s stakeholders — citizens, public authorities and economic stakeholders — that the city will really be able to be smart. Otherwise, it will only be mechanical or economic.” However, there is hope. There are currently many technological revolutions occurring simultaneously with respect to data, many of which are converging to offer unprecedented trust in digital systems. We as people have the innate ability to speak to one another and develop a sense of social trust. We don’t all share the same capabilities with the systems that we interact with on a daily basis, or even with the organisations that attempt to develop them for our benefit. However, there have been major advancements in cryptography, distributed systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence, as well as the emergence of new connection capabilities reaching out into the most underserved populations around the world. Through their convergence, we now have the capacity to solve many of the problems associated with globalisation and inequality, offering a rebalancing of the benefits for the major stakeholders in the context of smart cities. This can’t be done with decisions and advancements by any one key stakeholder, or even two. It requires the involvement of all three major sets of social stakeholders: the cities themselves (public authorities), private and public companies helping satisfy the requirements of the city (economic stakeholders), and the citizens who, ultimately, will be the ones to receive the benefit as the predominant users. The barriers to gathering data and involving all the stakeholders in the conversation are dropping with advancements in distributed technology and connected systems Working together, each must begin to communicate with others in order to make fully informed decisions about regulation and policy making, private economic growth and social inclusion from those whom it will affect the most. The barriers to gathering data and involving all the stakeholders in the conversation are dropping with advancements in distributed technology and connected systems, and with them also the barriers to understanding what’s needed most to address key problems due to the new wealth of information available. Making these decisions in an informed way and involving the three major stakeholders requires the use of publicly developed standards that regulators can build on and take advantage of to make decisions using data gathered from their cities, while also helping the local residents to trust that their data is protected, allowing for stable economic growth that contributes to the social good rather than hindering it. That can be done, for example, by using new technologies such as the protocol that we have developed at the IOTA Foundation. In our model, the three distinct stakeholder groups have access to a common platform that’s working towards standardisation. Cities become smart by taking multiple types of data and interlacing them for smarter solutions that create an impact on residents, visitors, businesses and local government. The IOTA permissionless technology can connect systems in Mobility, Energy, Infrastructure and more. Allowing a common, trusted, standardised platform for sharing and securing data openly. Whether that be by integrating open data portals for gathering and relaying public safety data and public works progress, enabling secure communications and survey systems with stakeholder groups for new digital city initiatives, or even gathering live traffic data to help understand the demands of transportation systems. All of this can be enabled in an open, frictionless and trusted platform using new permissionless and distributed technologies for infrastructure and data sharing. It allows for all parties to come together on an even playing field and ensure that decisions aren’t being made in a bubble, making certain that the ones who need to be there the most are not left out of the conversation and decision-making process IOTA has been developed with transparency in mind through complete open-source frameworks and is built to connect key infrastructure areas such as mobility, energy, and telecommunications with a common platform, enabling a digital trust, akin to the social trust we foster between each other every day. It allows for all parties to come together on an even playing field and ensure that decisions aren’t being made in a bubble, making certain that the ones who need to be there the most are not left out of the conversation and decision-making process. It’s designed for integration in devices as small as the sensors in your mobile device, allowing the data to be secured, compartmentalised, and permissioned from the source. Importantly, IOTA enables systems that were not traditionally interoperable to share data autonomously, with trust as the core requirement, connecting different sectors of government seamlessly and allowing all participants to be equal with respect to data, who owns it, and who needs to access it. — Mathew Yarger (Picture Credit: Unsplash) Discover inspiring tools, resources and policies curated for your needs.

14,"This article is written by Andrew Phillips, National Management Trainee, Brent Council As a recent graduate into Local Government, I had a few preconceptions about what the job would be like. The comments I got from friends revolved around stereotypes of bureaucracy, process and bin collections. I could not help but worry that these comments would hold a semblance of truth. Thankfully, that’s not been my experience at all after the first six months in the job — local government can and does make a difference. I want more people to engage in a career in local government, and here are a few of the things I have learned along the way. The new normal is for services to amalgamate — the extent to which surprised me. In order to attract young people and graduates — many of whom may also receive offers from the private sector — work needs to be varied and not one dimensional. Local Government is no longer regarded as the “job for life” it once was, and this ought to be factored into the nature of the work. In my job, I get the opportunity to be on four separate six-month placements in different areas of the council, which means that I have an opportunity to experience sometimes vastly different management and leadership styles. It’s been a steep learning curve in discovering what works and what doesn’t in different departments, as I’ve been in both customer-facing roles as well as placements that are predominantly strategic in nature. What I now associate with local government is a collective passion to serve, transformational leadership and a desire to enliven communities Navigating the political sphere is a key skill and is tied to civic duty — the relationships between councillors and officers is one that is vital in forming a successful and well-run council, with open and clear communication. The officer/councillor relationship is crucial. I have enjoyed it, and it creates a feeling of being involved in a whole process and seeing a decision through from beginning to end. My advice to a new graduate would be to attend as many whole council meetings as possible in order to understand the whole democratic process as well as contextualising day to day work. The culture of local government and work is changing. The modern public servant and potential leaders of the future need to be adaptable and possess transferable skills, as well as the “soft” skills that are a part of modern leadership. In order to cultivate a spirit of innovation, I have found it important to foster a culture where it’s ok to be wrong and to continually improve rather than to be risk-averse and always stick to tried and testing methods. It is not all about saying how you can fit into the workforce now, but about how can we change and adapt for the future, creating new visions and new roles. This is the attitude I’ve experienced during my first year of local government. Without this innovation, everything will remain the same, and the role of a new graduate should not always be to adhere to the status quo but also to put forward and produce new ideas that can challenge that narrative. I have assumed that role in the initial stages of my career. The way people build relationships and positive outcomes is through transformational leadership rather than siloed working. The “soft skills” required for those roles are ones which generally don’t change, irrespective of department. Local government is certainly never boring This is not only a positive development for junior public servants, but also for the workforce — modern public servants must be adaptable, which means less and less siloed working and a strong grasp of how local government operates. We don’t all agree what it means to be a modern public servant, but from my experience so far there are certainly steps which can be taken to develop future leaders. In terms of what that means for management, future leaders in local government will need to be versatile and able to move across different sectors. With different departments, it will be necessary to include knowledge of various sectors as opposed to a closed knowledge — evidently, that does not include the provision of specialised knowledge in sectors, for example in social care and children’s services. These skill-sets will need to remain, but partnership working is now the norm, not a competing approach. What I now associate with local government is a collective passion to serve, transformational leadership and a desire to enliven local communities. These values bind us together. The different ways of achieving these aims are key, and we should never be afraid to innovate. Whether that be areas as disparate as bin collections, commissioning or Public Health initiatives the key process remains the same. I am yet to encounter a colleague who is not trying to do things for the better of residents. The main takeaway has been this: local government is certainly never boring. — Andrew Phillips (Picture credit: Unsplash) Discover inspiring tools, resources and policies curated for your needs.
